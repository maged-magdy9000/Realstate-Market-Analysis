# Inrtoduction
Real estate has long been thought of as a relatively safe and lucrative investment, but it’s not always easy to get some skin in the game. For starters, saving for a down payment is often easier said than done. And you’ll need significant capital for renovations for flips or to get your unit ready as a rental. Fortunately for many people, though, there’s a way to invest in real estate without the leg work of saving up for a down payment or managing a property: real estate investment trusts.

# Project Name: Realstate Market Analysis
This project is a part of the [Data Analysis from property finders real state platform ](https://www.propertyfinder.eg/en) - Egypt's #1 property site, [Code for project study](https://github.com/maged-magdy9000/Realstate-Market-Analysis).  Other data science projects can be found at the [Main GitHub Repo](https://github.com/maged-magdy9000?tab=repositories).

## Objective
Real state market is the most trendy nowadays, billions of pounds invest in building new communities such as Egypt New Capital,  New cities have been created in last few years in deserts, plenty of manpower has working days & nights to make a dream came true,
which bring Egypt the number one choice for investors to put assets on.

by using data analysis Tool & Statistics to build a dashboard to answer some analytic questions & represent some insights that will boost investors' perception for making a good investment decision. 

### Technologies
* Python
* beautiful soup 
* Numpy, Pandas, jupyter
* Power Query
* Power BI

## Project Description:
### To ensure that investors have all knowledge to choose wisely I have answered some questions to being some insights 

* What is the most trendy city to invest in?
* What is the price tag depending on every district?
* How many units are shown for sale in the last 6 months?

* Which is the most expensive city & lowest one by the price tag?
* How many sales did the broker permit to an installment?
* If an investor has capital money, how does he invest it, and where?


## Strategies for this project
- Web Scrapping
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- Deployment(on time)


## Getting Started

### Step 1: gathering data

wite a python script using BEAUTIFUL SOUP library to scrapping dataset real state advertises for last 6 months from [Propertiy finder website](https://www.propertyfinder.eg/en/) and save it as CSV File           Clone this repo check [title](link ).

### Step 2:Exploratory data analysis

- using pandas library methods like info(),describe(),isnull(),duplicated(),dropna(),apply(),unique(),split(),groupby() 
and more many methods.

### Step 3:Data Wrangling

- Find NaN values (in this case I have to drop them)
- Find duplicated values 
- Detect Outliers Using IQR 
- Transform numeric data to labeled (as. feature installments)
- calculate new features like square meter price.
- extract texts from ads description (as. completion, Finishing state, Maid service, having a pool, covered parking, Security ..etc

### Step 4: Build Dashboard
To make interactive visualization, I use Power bi desktop it has more tools to get charts more professional.

Raw Data is being kept [title](link).  
Dataset after Data processing/transformation are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
