# Inrtoduction
Real estate has long been thought of as a relatively safe and lucrative investment, but it’s not always easy to get some skin in the game. For starters, saving for a down payment is often easier said than done. And you’ll need significant capital for renovations for flips or to get your unit ready as a rental. Fortunately for many people, though, there’s a way to invest in real estate without the leg work of saving up for a down payment or managing a property: real estate investment trusts.
